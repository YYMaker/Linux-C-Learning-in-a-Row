# Linux-C-Learning-in-a-Row
This is a book written by 宋劲杉 Linux C 编程一站式学习 and my code of some exercises. <br />
This is book is strongly recommended by myself for people who want to really understand C language, memory, and server programming.<br />
I keep a version of this book here hoping to help more Chinese coders especially those who are doing their undergraduate classes on computer science.<br />
